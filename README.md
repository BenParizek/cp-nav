## Install

- Add the `cpnav` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory.
- Navigate to Settings -> Plugins and click the "Install" button.
- Click on the `Control Panel Nav` link on the left-hand side (we figure you don't need another menu item to manage).


## Functionality

This plugin allows you to rename, reorder, or toggle visibility on menu items for the Control Panel.


## Roadmap

- Cleanup stale menu items when removing other plugins.
- Create menu configurations for user groups.
- Allow custom menu item creation. Useful for external links.
